## How to start the server / run the tests

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. We recommend the latest version (>= 13.12).

1. Make sure you are in the top-level directory of this project (viz. the directory this README file is in).

2. If this is the first time, install the required dependencies with `npm install`.

3. Now you can start the server with `npm start` or run the tests with `npm test`. As always, the tests will print out your point total and generate a `report.html` file.
